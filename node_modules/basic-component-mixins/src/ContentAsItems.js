   * [DistributedChildrenAsContent](DistributedChildrenAsContent.md) mixin.
   *
   * Items differ from element contents in several ways:
   *
   * * They are often referenced via index.
   * * They may have a selection state.
   * * It's common to do work to initialize the appearance or state of a new
   *   item.
   * * Auxiliary invisible child elements are filtered out and not counted as
   *   items. Auxiliary elements include link, script, style, and template
   *   elements. This filtering ensures that those auxiliary elements can be
   *   used in markup inside of a list without being treated as list items.
